A kubernetes network load balancer operator implementation.


**THIS SOFTWARE IS WORK IN PROGRESS / ALPHA RELEASE AND IS NOT MEANT FOR USAGE IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS**

## What is PaperLB ?
Vanilla kubernetes does not come with a LoadBalancer Service implementation. If you create a LoadBalancer Service in a self-hosted cluster setup, its status will remain "PENDING".

PaperLB allows you to use an external L4 load balancer (an nginx server for example) in front of your cluster services.

## How does it work ?
PaperLB is implemented as a kubernetes "Operator": 
- Custom Resource Definitions
- Kubernetes Controllers that manage the Custom Resources and interact with your load balancer 

The idea is:

- You create a kubernetes LoadBalancer type service and add some paperlb annotations
- The controller notices the service and annotations and creates a "LoadBalancer" object
- The controller notices the "LoadBalancer" object and updates your actual load balancer using the config from the annotations from and the service/nodes info


## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Usage
Service example:
````yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: k8s-pod-info-api
  name: k8s-pod-info-api-service
  annotations:
    lb.paperlb.com/http-updater-url: "http://192.168.64.1:3000/api/v1/lb"
    lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-host: "192.168.64.1"
    lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-port: "8100"
    lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-protocol: "TCP"
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 5000
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 4000
  selector:
    app: k8s-pod-info-api
  type: LoadBalancer
````

Annotations: 
- `lb.paperlb.com/http-updater-url`: URL where the http lb updater instance can be called. The API is explained here: https://github.com/didil/nginx-lb-updater#api
- `lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-host`: Load Balancer Host
- `lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-port`: Load Balancer Port
- `lb.paperlb.com/load-balancer-protocol`: Load Balancer Protocol (`TCP` or `UDP`)
 


### Run tests
To run tests:
```sh
make test
```

### Run locally
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

3. You will need to run a load balancer instance and an API to allow the load balancer to be updated. You can use the example from this repository https://github.com/didil/nginx-lb-updater#run-locally 

4. The demo folder contains sample resource definitions to create a service and deployment. You can tweak them and run:
```sh
kubectl apply -f demo/ 
```


**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
